# Advent-of-Code

## Description

Solutions to the Advent of Code challenges posted each year since 2015. 
&nbsp;All solutions presented will use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
methods to solve them. &nbsp;Each solution will include unit tests that test
the solution against the examples provided for that day.

## Events in this Repository

* [`2015`](2015/)

## Running the code

If the python file for the specified day is run by itself, the unit tests will
be run. &nbsp;When followed by a file path, it will open that file and process
that data as part of the solution. &nbsp;Some days do not include input files. 
&nbsp;These days usually included a single input that replaces a file path
on the command line.

### Unit Testing

```cmd
    [2015]$ python day1.py
    ...
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 3 tests in 0.000s

    OK
```

### Data Run

```cmd
    [2015]$ python day1.py data/day1.txt

    data/day1.txt:
    Part 1: Floor 280
    Part 2: Instruction 1797
