    Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

    Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.

    He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and 
    then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move 
    next. Moves are always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v), 
    east (>), or west (<). After each move, he delivers another present to the 
    house at his new location.

    Part 1: how many houses receive at least one present?
    Part 2: using robo-santa, how many houses receive at least one present?
